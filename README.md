# React Design Patterns

ðŸš€ React Design Patterns is a GitHub repository that explores best practices and reusable patterns for building scalable, maintainable, and efficient React applications. It covers essential patterns like Higher-Order Components (HOCs), Render Props, Compound Components, Custom Hooks, and more. Ideal for developers looking to improve their React architecture and write cleaner, more modular code.

## 1 -  Uncontrolled Components

An uncontrolled component in React is a form input element that manages its own state rather than relying on React state. This means that React does not control the value of the input field; instead, the DOM itself handles it.
```js
import { useRef } from "react";

function UncontrolledForm() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert(`Entered value: ${inputRef.current.value}`);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default UncontrolledForm;

```

When to Use Uncontrolled Components?

- When integrating with third-party libraries that manipulate the DOM
- When you donâ€™t need real-time control of input values
- When working with simple forms that donâ€™t require state synchronization
- 
For more complex forms that need validation, default values, or conditional rendering, controlled components (using useState) are usually preferred.


## 2 - Controlled Components

In React, Controlled Components are those in which formâ€™s data is handled by the componentâ€™s state. It takes its current value through props and makes changes through callbacks like onClick, onChange, etc. A parent component manages its own state and passes the new values as props to the controlled component.
```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function ControlledForm() {
  const [error, setError] = useState("");
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [age, setAge] = useState();

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log(name, age);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(name.length);

    if (name.length < 1) {
      setError(`name cannot be empty`);
    } else {
      setError("");
    }
  }, [name]);

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {error && <p>{error}</p>}
      <input
        type="text"
        name="name"
        value={name}
        placeholder="Name"
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
      />

      <input
        type="number"
        name="age"
        value={age}
        placeholder="Age"
        onChange={(e) => setAge(e.target.value)}
      />

      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

```

When to Use Controlled Components?

- When you need real-time updates (e.g., validation, formatting)
- When the input value depends on other state variables
- When handling dynamic forms
- When integrating with React state management (Redux, Context API, etc.)


For simple cases where React doesn't need to control the input, uncontrolled components (using ref) might be more efficient. ðŸš€
